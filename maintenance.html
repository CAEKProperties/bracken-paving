						<h2>Seal Coating</h2>
						
						<h4>Preparation/Cleaning of Your Asphalt Driveway</h4>
						
						<p>In order for sealer to adhere and perform its best the asphalt must be properly prepared by a process of cleaning and repairing any damage to the asphalt. Bracken Asphalt has a strict standard for cleaning and preparing a driveway before sealer is applied, which allows us to be confident in the wear of our product.</p>
						
						<p>At Bracken Asphalt, we will clean your asphalt with a blower and steel brush to assure the maximum performance of the sealer. We will also weed eat the edges to assure a clean crisp look and to allow for sealing all the way to the edge of the asphalt.</p>
						
						<p>If for any reason your asphalt needs further cleaning with a pressure washer, shovel, or automated brushing system there will be an additional charge that your sales/ customer service representative will be happy to explain to you.</p>
						
						<h4>Application of Asphalt Sealer</h4>
						
						<p>After your parking area / driveway has been properly cleaned and the necessary crack fill has been applied we will apply a coal-tar sealer.</p>
						
						<p>We use "GemSeal" sealer which is warranted to meet or exceed all requirements of ASTM D5727 specifications and then we add sand and latex, which extends its wearability.</p>
						
						<p>We will trim all the edges of your driveway with a brush to assure a neat job and spray the surface with a spray unit which produces an even application over the entire drive.</p>
						
						<h4>Proper Care for Your Asphalt Driveway</h4>
						
						<p>After your driveway is sealed you should stay off it for 24 to 48 hours to allow the sealer to properly cure.</p>
						
						<p>Although seal-coating protects against gas and oil seepage we recommend you clean spills as soon as possible after the occurrence. To clean your driveway use a hose and mild detergent.</p>
						
						<p>Protect your driveway from harsh chemicals used in car care such as tire cleaners, tar remover, tire blackener etc. such chemicals will cause a reaction with the sealer causing it to have a cloudy appearance.</p>
						
						<p>Do not turn the steering wheel of a stationary vehicle on your driveway, as the tire will cause a scuff mark on the asphalt and repeated scuffing in one area will damage the sealer and the asphalt.</p>

					<section id="crack-sealing">
						<h2>Crack Sealing</h2>
						<p>Cracking is a normal part of the life-cycle of asphalt, however cracks that are not dealt with properly expose your pavement to accelerated deterioration. One of the primary enemies to asphalt is water weakening the base and one of the primary ways water gets under your asphalt is through cracks.</p>

						<p>For this reason it is very important that the cracks on your asphalt be sealed. In our area the damage by water getting under asphalt is increased due to the freeze / thaw cycle. At Bracken we clean each crack as needed and fill it with a rubberized crack sealant. Our crack sealant is specifically designed for parking areas and exceeds federal specifications for highway use.</p>

						<p>Because crack sealing is not designed to add beauty to your driveway, we recommend seal-coating after the application of crack sealing to improve its appearance.</p>

					<section id="infrared">
						<h2>Infrared</h2>
						<p>Bracken Asphalt offers state-of-the-art asphalt repair through the infrared process. Infrared is a relatively new technique of seamless repair for alligator cracking, pothole repair and utility-cuts.</p>
						
						<p>With infrared repair, the area to be repaired is heated until the asphalt is soft, then it is loosened with a rake and fresh asphalt is applied, as well as an asphalt rejuvenator, which reintroduces the original chemical composition into the repaired area. The repaired area is then raked level with the existing asphalt. The repair is now ready for compaction. Using a steel vibratory roller the edge is "heat welded" leaving a seamless repair and the entire area is rolled leaving the asphalt as good as it was originally.</p>
						
						<p>Infrared doesn't leave a cutout seam, which allows water to re-enter the repair starting the cycle of failure over, which makes infrared repair a better option for certain types of repair work. Where there is base failure the traditional cut-out repair is the better option, because it allows for the base to be examined and repaired.</p>
